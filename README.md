Description:
Coffee and Donut ordering application. Coffees and donuts can stored into a order list, 
the order list containing a set number of menu items can be stored into the list of orders. 

Functionality:
Coffee objects can be added to an order list. A coffee can have a size, quantity and list of addins.
Donut objects can also be added to the order list. A donut object has a donut type and quantity.
The price of these menu items is also stored in the order list. The "Your Order" tab contains
the current list of menu items(the order list), and computes the total price of all the menu items stored. 
You can either remove a menu item (by clicking on it.), or store the current list of ordered menu items 
into the list of orders. The "Store Orders" tab let's you see the list of orders. Just like the order list,
the list of orders lets you remove an order that you click on. The final price of all orders is also 
computed in this tab.
